# Emotion detection using deep learning

## Introduction

This project has two goals:
 - it aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of **seven categories**, using deep convolutional neural networks. The model is trained on the **FER-2013** dataset which was published on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with **seven emotions** - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised;

  - it aims to classify the distraction of the driver into one of **five categories**, using a custom dataset based on frontal face's photos of drivers, given by **Ortega, J.

## Dependencies

* Python 3, [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)


## Algorithm

* First, the **haar cascade** method is used to detect faces in each frame of the webcam feed.

* The region of image containing the face is resized to **48x48** and is passed as input to both the CNNs (distractions and emotions).

* The network outputs a list of **softmax scores** for the seven classes of emotions and the five classes of distractions.

* The model prints out all emotions and distractions, giving a value between 0 and 1 to all of them. The higher ones are the current ones detected by the models.
